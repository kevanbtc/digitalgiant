```
To every sales professional who's been told "we're going digital"

To every networking expert whose events got "optimized away"

Your connections aren't outdated - they're INVALUABLE.
Your relationships aren't replaceable - they're your GOLDMINE.
Your network isn't obsolete - it's your SUPERPOWER.
